#Project 4 - Interactive Photo Gallery

Main Objective:  Create an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery from provided photos with descriptions.

Note: These projects are intended to train you in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement the designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#Features:

- Create a lightbox effect when user clicks an image.
- Create arrow indicators to let the user browse through photos left and right.
- Create a search engine that will filter certain photos based on keywords.
